### 🧩 Parking Lot / Future Enhancements

- Paper-trading order flow via Alpaca (long-only MVP).

### 🧰 Migration Notes

- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to apply new dependencies.
- Ensure `.env` includes updated keys:  
  `TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `ALPACA_API_KEY`, `ALPACA_API_SECRET`, and `AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING`.
- After deploying to Azure, **immediately call**:
  <https://api.telegram.org/bot/setWebhook>
- using your **App Service URL** and `TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.
